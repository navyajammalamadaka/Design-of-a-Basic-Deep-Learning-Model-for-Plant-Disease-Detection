# Design-of-a-Basic-Deep-Learning-Model-for-Plant-Disease-Detection

Plant disease has become a major threat to global food security. Plant diseases contribute 10–16% losses in
the global harvest of crops each year costing an estimated US$220 billion . According to a report of the Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) , our world population is anticipated to hit 9.1 billion in 2050.
Therefore, agricultural production needs to be increased up to 70% to fulfill the food requirements of a
steadily growing population. On the other hand, abundant use of chemicals such as bactericides, fungicides,
and nematicides to control plant diseases has been causing adverse effects in the agro-ecosystem. Currently,
there is a need for effective early disease detection techniques to control plant diseases for food security and
sustainability of agro-ecosystem.
